Build instructions
Just download the folder and open the project from android studio

Home.java is the renamed main activity

WHERE TO LOOK FOR COMMENTS
Many of the java files are near copies of one another (should be one activity that changes based on extra data, but no time to change)
Look for comments in only the first file
i.e. 
For Lesson1 to Lesson6
	see Lesson1.java for comments

For Lesson1_1, Lesson 1_2, ... Lesson 5_6, Lesson 5_7
	Lesson1_1 is the only activity to use static content
	see Lesson1_2.java for comments regarding all other lessons, which use parsed API content

For Quiz1 to Quiz5 and Quiz1Complete to Quiz5Complete
	see Quiz1 and Quiz1Complete for comments
